It involves the control and automation of Humidity sensor, Soil sensor, LDR sensor (photo sensor) and Temperature sensor. WIFI is often used for remote monitoring and control. Crop Tech, when remotely monitored and controlled via the internet, are important constituent of the plant. Modern system generally consist of switches and sensors connected to a central hub sometime called a “gateway” from which the system is controlled with a user interface that interacts with either wall mount terminal, mobile phone software, tablet computer or web interface,often but not always via internet cloud services. There are some benefits  Increased production  Water conservation  Real_time data and production Lower operation cost Remote monitoring
